TAG_Network:Networks consists of multiple cells and shows what genes are correlated within that group. The genes are represented with spheres and the correlations are represented with lines. The lines' colors are random and have no meaning. Arcs between networks can be toggled with from the arc menu. Arcs are connections between networks where a pair of genes is present in both networks.
TAG_HeatBoard:Heatmaps shows genes that are expressed or not expressed in cells. The selected cells are shown on the x-axis of the heatmap ordered from left to right in the order they were selected. The genes are shown on the y-axis and their names can be found on the right most side of the heatmap. A button on the left side of the heatmap recolors the graphs to the colors used when creating the heatmap. This will color all cells in all graphs so you can see where the cells are in the other graphs as well.
TAG_Graph:Graphs consist of multiple cells that are ordered by an algorithm. Cells that are close to each other probably have something to do with each other, and cells far away from each other probably have less to do with each other.
TAG_Folder:This box represents a folder on this computer. Move the controller close to open the box. The text on the lid is the name of the folder.
TAG_Loader:This is the loading machine. Put some spheres from a box into the funnel to load a folder with data. Once the data is loaded, the loading machine will dissapear. To go back to the loading machine, press "Loading menu" on the main menu (located on one of your controllers).

# Names of gameobjects:
Cells:These spheres represent the files inside a folder. To pick them up, move the controller inside the cells and press the grip buttons. Put the spheres inside the loading machine to load this data. The loading machine is on the ground between all the boxes.

# Names of buttons:
Selectiontool Button:Toggles the selection tool. The selection tool selects cells in a graph. Use the thumb dial on the controller to change the selection tool's color. Once you are happy with your selection, use the menu to confirm it.
Toggle Keyboard Button:Toggles the keyboard. Use the keyboard by pointing at it with the controller and press the trigger to type. Typing a gene name and then pressing "Set color" will color all current graphs after their expression of that gene, if it is present in the supplied database. Cells are colored blue to red via yellow with blue representing the lowest expression and red representing the highest.
Burn Heatmap Tool Button:Toggles the tool for removing heatmaps. Put the fire inside an undesired heatmap and press the trigger to remove it.
Reset Graphs Button:Resets all graphs' positions, rotations, scales and color. Does not affect networks, heatmaps or anything else.
Reset Folder Button:Returns you to the select folder stage. Removes all networks, heatmaps and graphs from the current scene.
Minimizer Tool Button:Toggles the minimizer tool. Put the shiny red light inside a graph or network and press the trigger to minimize it. Minimized objects are put in little boxes on top of the menu. Putting the controller inside a minimized object and pressing the trigger will return it to its former size and position.
SaveButton:Saves your progress. Ask Johan to write more info.
Magnifier Tool Button:Toggles the magnifier tool. The magnifier can be used to look inside clusters of cells in a graph. Put the sphere inside a graph and move it to move the cells apart.
ScreenshotButton:Toggles the ability to take a screenshot. Press this button and then press the trigger to take a screenshot. Screenshots are saved in the same location as the program.
Arcs Menu Button:Shows the arc menu. An arc is a connection between two networks that have a matching pair of connected genes. The buttons in the arc menu each have a background color corresponding to which network's arcs they toggle. Pressing a green button will toggle all connected arcs on and pressing a red button will toggle them off. The four buttons on the bottom of the menu are for toggling all arcs on or off, and toggling the combined number of arcs between networks on or off respectively. Below these buttons is a button for closing the menu.
ConfirmSelectionButton:Confirms your selection. After confirming a selection more cells cannot be added to it. You must confirm a selection before creating a heatmap or networks.
RemoveSelection:Removes all selected cells from a graph. This can be undone by pressing "Reset graphs".
UndoSelectionButton:Undoes your current selection. All selected cells will be un-selected.
CreateHeatmapButton:Creates a heatmap from your selection. The heatmap will have the selected cells on its x-axis and 250 genes on its y-axis. The cells are ordered from left to right in the order they were selected. The heatmap can be moved by grabbing it with one controller and rescaled by grabbing it with both controllers.
Create Networks Button:Creates a group of networks from your selection. Each color will be used as one network. Each network will show genes that are correlated. The genes are represented with spheres and the correlations as lines between the spheres. The lines' colors mean nothing, they are randomized for easier viewing. The networks are placed on a skeleton-like structure of the graph they came from to give an idea of where they originate from in the graph. The skeleton can be moved by grabbing it with one controller. Move the controller inside a network and press the trigger to enlarge it and separate it from the skeleton.
Toggle Expressed Cells:Use this button after coloring the graphs after a gene's expression. Toggles all cells in the graph that are expressing the gene.
Toggle Non Expressed Cells: Use this button after coloring the graphs after a gene's expression. Toggles all cells in the graph that are not expressing the gene.
StartMenuButton:Brings you back to the start menu. All unsaved progress will be lost.
Attribute Menu Button:Shows the attribute menu. Pressing a button in the menu will toggle the color of cells belonging to that attribute. Use the button on the bottom of this menu to close it.
Index Menu Button:Show the menu to color by index. Pressing any button in this menu will color all cells based on their value of the index. I do not really know what any of that means.
Lasers:Toggles laser pointers. The lasers can be used to press various buttons around you. The lasers will turn green when they are pointing at something that can be interacted with. The lasers can grab graphs, heatmaps and networks by pointing them at something and pressing the grip buttons.
Save Heatmap Button:Saves this heatmap to the disk. The image will be located where CellExAl is installed in the Saved_Images folder. The current date and time will be appended to the file name.
Undo One Step Button:This button undoes the last selected cell. Press many times to undo more cells.
Redo One Step Button:This button redoes the last undone cell. Press many times to redo more cells.
Undo Ten Steps Button:This button undoes the last 10 selected cells. Press many times to undo more cells.
Redo Ten Steps Button:This button redoes the last 10 selected cells. Press many times to redo more cells.
Toggle Arcs On Button:This button toggles all arcs on for the network(s) it is connected to. Use the green button to toggle all connected arcs on, and the red button to toggle them off. Buttons with a colored background toggle the arcs to the network with the same network. The buttons on the bottom toggle all arcs connected to all networks in the group, and toggle the combined arcs. The combined arcs show how many arcs there are between two networks in total.
Toggle Arcs Off ButtonThis button toggles all arcs off for the network(s) it is connected to. Use the green button to toggle all connected arcs on, and the red button to toggle them off. Buttons with a colored background toggle the arcs to the network with the same network. The buttons on the bottom toggle all arcs connected to all networks in the group, and toggle the combined arcs. The combined arcs show how many arcs there are between two networks in total.
Tab Button:If there is more than one group of networks, this button can be used to show the tab of buttons that toggle arcs for this group of networks. One tab appears for each group of networks that are generated.
