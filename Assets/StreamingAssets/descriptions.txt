# Comments can be written by starting a line with a '#'.
# Syntax: [[name of gameobject] or "TAG_"[name of tag]]:[description]
# All descriptions should be put on exactly one (1) line. Line breaks can be inserted by typing '\n'.
# The purpose of this file is to contain longer descriptions that are displayed with the helper tool.
# Gameobjects can be given descriptions based on the following: name, tag, parents name.
# The parents name must be the direct parent to the gameobject.
# Note that if a gameobject has more than one quality (e.g. both a name and a tag) that has a description in this file, the priorities are: name, tag, name of parent.

TAG_Network:Networks consists of multiple cells and shows what genes are correlated within that group. The genes are represented with spheres and the correlations are represented with lines. The lines' colors are random and have no meaning. Arcs between networks can be toggled with from the arc menu. Arcs are connections between networks where a pair of genes is present in both networks.
TAG_HeatBoard:Heatmaps shows genes that are expressed or not expressed in cells. The selected cells are shown on the x-axis of the heatmap ordered from left to right in the order they were selected. The genes are shown on the y-axis and their names can be found on the right most side of the heatmap. Point the help tool at the buttons on the left side for more info about what they do.
TAG_Graph:Graphs consist of multiple cells that are ordered by an algorithm. Cells that are close to each other probably have something to do with each other, and cells far away from each other probably have less to do with each other.
TAG_Folder:This box represents a folder on this computer. Move the controller close to open the box. The text on the lid is the name of the folder.
TAG_Sphere:These spheres represent the data inside a folder. Grab the spheres by moving the controller inside them and press the grip buttons. To load this data, put the spheres inside the loading machine on the ground.
TAG_Loader:This is the loading machine. Put some spheres from a box into the funnel to load a folder with data. Once the data is loaded, the loading machine will disappear. To go back to the loading machine, press "Loading menu" on the main menu (located on one of your controllers).

# Names of gameobjects 
Cells:These spheres represent the files inside a folder. To pick them up, move the controller inside the cells and press the grip buttons. Put the spheres inside the loading machine to load this data. The loading machine is on the ground between all the boxes.
Keyboard:The keyboard can be used to search the supplied database for a genename and color the graphs after that gene's expression level. Use the controller you are pointing towards the keyboard and press the trigger to type (turn off this tool first though). Then press "Set colour". It might take a bit of time to find the gene you entered depending on the size of the database. The graphs will then be colored blue to red via yellow. Blue means low expression levels, yellow medium levels, and red high. Genes you search for will appear in the history on the left of the keyboard.
Previous Searches List:Genes you search for using the keyboard will appear here. Point the controller towards one of the genes in the list to color the graphs according to that gene's expression. 
Lock:Pressing one of the locks will make the gene to the lock's right stay in its position in the list. This is can be used to compare one gene to many other genes without having to retype the gene's name. Press the lock again to unlock the gene's position.
Correlated genes button:Pressing one of the arrows will calculate a gene's 10 most correlated and 10 most anti-correlated genes. The new genenames will appear in two lists on the left and the gene you press will be displayed on top of those lists. This might a bit of time depending on the number of genes in the dataset.
Correlated Genes List:Pressing a gene in these lists will color the graphs according to its expression. The list to the right are the 10 most correlated genes to the gene above the list. The list to the left are the 10 most anti-correlated genes.
Linear Button:Pressing this button chooses the linear coloring mode. This mode will color the cells with each color covering an even range of expression levels.
Ranked Button:Pressing this button chooses the ranked coloring mode. This mode will force each color represent the same number of cells. This means that a color no longer is representing an even range of expression levels, but rather a range of cells that have similar expression levels. This has the side effect of maybe amplifying noise.

# Names of items in the help menu:
Controller Help:The controllers you are holding have 3 primary buttons that CellexalVR use. The trigger button on the bottom side of the controller can be pressed with your index finger. The grip buttons are also located on the underside of the controller, there are two grip buttons on each controller. They are striated and should be pressed by "squeezing" the controller with your palm, long finger and ring finger. These buttons are typically used to grab and move things. The last buttons are the big round ones on the top side of the controllers. They can be pressed with your thumb. Gently touching on the dial with your thumb will show a menu with four icons. Pressing the button a bit harder will press the selected item in the menu.
Menu Help:The main menu can activate tools that can interact with the environment. Access the menu by pressing the left controller's trigger button. Point the laser towards a button to find out more about what it does.
Tips And Tricks Help:Some tips and tricks:\nPut the controller that has the menu in your non-dominant hand so it's easier to navigate the menu with your dominant hand.\nPutting the right controller inside the menu will temporarily deactivate the tool you are using to make it easier to use the menu. If you want to use a tool, put the menu away by pressing the menu controller's trigger button or just lower your hand.\nRemember to set a username when starting the program so CellexalVR can write pretty logs for you. The logs are stored locally in the Output/[username]/ directory.

# Names of buttons on the menu:

# Selection Tool Menu
Selectiontool Button:Show the menu for the selection tool.
NewSelection:Toggles the selection tool. The selection tool selects cells in a graph. Use the thumb dial on the controller to change the selection tool's color. Once you are happy with your selection, use the menu to confirm it.
ConfirmSelectionButton:Confirms your selection. After confirming a selection more cells cannot be added to it. You must confirm a selection before creating a heatmap or networks.
RemoveSelection:Removes all selected cells from a graph. This can be undone by pressing "Reset graphs".
UndoSelectionButton:Undoes your current selection. All selected cells will be un-selected.
CreateHeatmapButton:Creates a heatmap from your selection. The heatmap will have the selected cells on its x-axis and 250 genes on its y-axis. The cells are ordered from left to right in the order they were selected. The heatmap can be moved by grabbing it with one controller and rescaled by grabbing it with both controllers.
Create Networks Button:Creates a group of networks from your selection. Each color will be used as one network. Each network will show genes that are correlated. The genes are represented with spheres and the correlations as lines between the spheres. The lines' colors mean nothing, they are randomized for easier viewing. The networks are placed on a skeleton-like structure of the graph they came from to give an idea of where they originate from in the graph. The skeleton can be moved by grabbing it with one controller. Move the controller inside a network and press the trigger to enlarge it and separate it from the skeleton.
Color Graphs After Current Selection Button:Colors all the other graphs based on your current selection. All cells in other graphs that share the same label will be given the same color that you have colored it with.

Magnifier Tool Button:Toggles the magnifier tool. The magnifier can be used to look inside clusters of cells in a graph. Put the sphere inside a graph and move it to move the cells apart.
ScreenshotButton:Toggles the ability to take a screenshot. Press this button and then press "up" on the touchpad to take a screenshot. Screenshots are saved in the Screenshots folder.
Arcs Menu Button:Shows the arc menu. An arc is a connection between two networks that have a matching pair of connected genes. The buttons in the arc menu each have a background color corresponding to which network's arcs they toggle. Pressing a green button will toggle all connected arcs on and pressing a red button will toggle them off. The four buttons on the bottom of the menu are for toggling all arcs on or off, and toggling the combined number of arcs between networks on or off respectively. Below these buttons is a button for closing the menu.
Toggle Expressed Cells:Use this button after coloring the graphs after a gene's expression. Toggles all cells in the graph that are expressing the gene.
Toggle Non Expressed Cells: Use this button after coloring the graphs after a gene's expression. Toggles all cells in the graph that are not expressing the gene.
StartMenuButton:Brings you back to the start menu. All unsaved progress will be lost.
Attribute Menu Button:Shows the attribute menu. Pressing a button in the menu will toggle the color of cells belonging to that attribute. Use the button on the bottom of this menu to close it.
Attribute Button:Depending on the chosen mode, this button eiher colors all cells by this attribute, or switches the boolean logic operator for this attribute.
Switch Attribute Mode Button:Switch the mode between single attribute mode and boolean logic mode. In single attribute mode, each button representing an attribute can be pressed to color all cells if they are part of that attribute, cells that are not part of that attribute will not have their colored changed. In boolean logic mode, each button can be set to one of three states: "off", "and" and "not". The "off" state means that the attribute won't be considered when coloring graphs, the "and" state means that cells must be part of this attribute to be colored, and the "not" state means that cells must not be part of this attribute to be colored. The buttons representing the attributes will change colors based on their mode; black means "off", green means "and" and red means "not".
Index Menu Button:Show the menu to color by index. Pressing any button in this menu will color all cells based on their value of the index. I do not really know what any of that means.
Lasers:Toggles laser pointers. The lasers can be used to press various buttons around you. The lasers will turn green when they are pointing at something that can be interacted with. The lasers can grab graphs, heatmaps and networks by pointing them at something and pressing the grip buttons.
Close Menu Button:Close the open menu.

# Arcs
Toggle Arcs On Button:This button toggles all arcs on for the network(s) it is connected to. Use the green button to toggle all connected arcs on, and the red button to toggle them off. Buttons with a colored background toggle the arcs to the network with the same network. The buttons on the bottom toggle all arcs connected to all networks in the group, and toggle the combined arcs. The combined arcs show how many arcs there are between two networks in total.
Toggle Arcs Off Button:This button toggles all arcs off for the network(s) it is connected to. Use the green button to toggle all connected arcs on, and the red button to toggle them off. Buttons with a colored background toggle the arcs to the network with the same network. The buttons on the bottom toggle all arcs connected to all networks in the group, and toggle the combined arcs. The combined arcs show how many arcs there are between two networks in total.

All graphs will be colored according to the gene expression of a randomly chosen gene in that category before a new gene expression is chosen. After 10 seconds random genes in the next category is shown for 10 seconds and so on. The same gene expression can appear zero, one or any number of times depending on the mood of the random number generator.
Shuffled Category Mode Button:Press to switch to the "shuffled category mode". This will show each category in the order they appear in the input file. All graphs will be colored according to one gene expression at a time. Each gene expression will be shown exactly one time, in a random order. The time it takes to show all of one category depends on the number of genes in that category.
Ordered Category Button:Press to switch to the "ordered category mode". This will show each category in the order they appear in the input file, and all genes within each category as they are ordered in the input file.
Stop Flashing Genes Button:Press to stop the flashing genes. Pressing any mode button again will resume the flashing.
Color By Gene Menu Button:Press to show the menu for calculating top differentially expressed genes. For this to work you must first make a grouping with one red group and one non-red group.
