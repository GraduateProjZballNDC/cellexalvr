step 1: download r version 3.3.3 from
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
Step 2: To run heatmap generation you need to install packages pheatmap and gplots. 
You can make sure dependencies are working as intended by running the Make_heatmap_from_CellIS_list.R script from command line/terminal.
Step 3: In Assets/Config there is a file called config.example.txt. Save it as config.txtm then put the location of your R installation there, specifically the R x64 directory. For me it looks like this:
C:\Program Files\R\R-3.3.3\bin\x64

Optionally:
step 4: if using windows edit path to include R. First find the edit environment
variables window. The top part should list variables PATH, TEMP and TMP.
Go in and edit the PATH variable. Here you add a new path variable, specifically
the location of your R x64 directory. For me it looks like this:
C:\Program Files\R\R-3.3.3\bin\x64
step 5: r.exe and rscript should now be executable from the windows command prompt.
r.exe is interactive and rscript executes scripts. Make a copy of the config.example.txt and enter the R filepath. Simply writing rscript.exe as your R file path in the config file should work now.

If the script won't execute it probably has to do with file paths. RScriptRunner outputs error messages to error.txt in Assets/Config
